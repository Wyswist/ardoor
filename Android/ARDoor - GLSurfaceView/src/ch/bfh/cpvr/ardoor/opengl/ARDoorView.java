/**
 * A simple GLSurfaceView sub-class that demonstrate how to perform
 * OpenGL ES 2.0 rendering into a GL Surface. Note the following important
 * details:
 *
 * - The class must use a custom context factory to enable 2.0 rendering.
 *   See ContextFactory class definition below.
 *
 * - The class must use a custom EGLConfigChooser to be able to select
 *   an EGLConfig that supports 2.0. This is done by providing a config
 *   specification to eglChooseConfig() that has the attribute
 *   EGL10.ELG_RENDERABLE_TYPE containing the EGL_OPENGL_ES2_BIT flag
 *   set. See ConfigChooser class definition below.
 *
 * - The class must select the surface's format, then choose an EGLConfig
 *   that matches it exactly (with regards to red/green/blue/alpha channels
 *   bit depths). Failure to do so would result in an EGL_BAD_MATCH error.
